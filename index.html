        <p>Hey. </p>

<p>I'm Jessica Yang.</p>
<p>I'm interested in how healthcare and media intersects, as well as the dissemination of health-related issues. I spend some of my time writing technical dermatology news into layman's terms for Case Western Reserve's School of Medicine. </p> 
<p>However, I started out on the web as a blogger, writing book reviews and other book-related posts at <a href="http://crazyredpen.com">Crazy Red Pen</a>, in 2009. Since then, I've also written for Huffington Post, Quirk Books blog, Mochi Mag and more. I'm passionate about Asian American Pacific Islander issues, especially as it relates to literature, as well as the intersection of health and pop culture. </p>

<p>I am a biochemistry and psychology student and I love seeing two different fields of study connect. </p>
<p>Let's talk: hello [@]
